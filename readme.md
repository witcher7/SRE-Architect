## üßë‚Äçüíª What I Teach

### üöÄ Full Stack Development

- **Node.js**: From REST APIs to real-time apps, master JavaScript on the server!
- **Golang**: Build ultra-fast, scalable services in one of the hottest languages.
- **Python Frameworks**: Django, Flask, FastAPI ‚Äì for everything from web dev to AI.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Engineering ‚Äî **Architect Level**

- **AWS, GCP, Azure:**  
  Master cloud at architect level:  
  - Design secure, scalable, and highly-available solutions  
  - Deep-dive into VPC, IAM, multi-region, DR, and hybrid architectures  
  - Cost optimization and enterprise patterns

### üõ†Ô∏è DevOps ‚Äî **Professional Level**

- **DevOps Ninja:**  
  CI/CD, automation, secrets management, infra as code (Terraform, Ansible)
- **Kubernetes Mastery:**  
  - CKA/CKAD/CKS-level cluster management  
  - Helm, GitOps (ArgoCD), advanced workloads, observability, and security  
  - Real production scenarios and troubleshooting

### ‚ö° Serverless ‚Äî **Kratos Level**

- **Serverless Architectures:**  
  - AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, EventBridge, Step Functions  
  - Build, deploy, and scale serverless apps like a true demigod  
  - Design patterns, event-driven systems, SaaS, and microservices
    
- **Multiple backend frameworks** with *production-ready* code (Node.js, Go, Django, Flask, FastAPI)
  
- **SRE Architect learning folder**:  
  - Pro DevOps tools: Terraform, Ansible, Docker, K8s, CI/CD  
  - DevSecOps: Trivy, OPA, Kube-bench, sealed-secrets, SOPS  
  - Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Tempo, Mimir, EFK/ELK  
  - GitOps: ArgoCD, FluxCD  
  - Cloud blueprints: AWS, GCP, Azure
  - Job scenarios: Real-world production drills, incident handling, troubleshooting
    
- **Serverless Architectures**: Lambda, EventBridge, DynamoDB, best patterns

- **No institute**: Pure learning, open for students, self-paced, with step-by-step guides & hands-on projects

## üí° Who‚Äôs This For?

- Students aiming to become **true SRE/DevOps architects**
- Self-learners prepping for real production environments & interviews
- Anyone tired of ‚Äútheory-only‚Äù and wants **hands-on battle skills**
